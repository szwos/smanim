#TODO: maybe make a fork of pyTree library and put this code as ported to python 3

#TODO: check if this Tree even works XD

#TODO:
# create DrawableTree class, that will use Tree class, but will have smanim specific operations available (encapsulation basically)
# try to make DrawableObject class, that will implement Node class, so that it can be stored on the tree, but this object will also only have library specific operations
# this object will be a general object, that all objects that can be drawn (rasterized / appear on screen) will inherit after
